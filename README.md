# Mr. Roboger's Neighborhood

#### This is a Behavior Driven Development (BDD) Exercise involving loops and arrays for Epicodus, 05.14.2020

#### By Brittany Lindgren

## Description

Use BDD to write specifications for a program that will take in a number from the user and return a range of numbers from 0 up to the user's number, replacing certain digits with 'beeb', 'boop', or 'Won't you be my neighbor?". Based on these specifications, implement the program.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository.
* To view the code itself, open in a text editor such as VS Code or Atom, etc.
* To view in your browser, double click on index.html.
* You do not need to run a server to view this document.

## Known Bugs

At this time, if username is not entered, numbers including a 3 return 'Won't you be my neighbor,  ?'  with space where name would be. Need to fix but to return without comma and whitespace if no name is entered.

## Mr. Roboger's Neighborhood Rules
1. Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
2. Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
3. Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Won't you be my neighbor?"

* Rule 3 takes precedence over rule 2, and rule 2 over rule 1, so:
* The number 13 should be replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"
* The number 21 should be replaced with "Boop".
* The number 32 should be replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"

## Specifications

#### Spec 1
* Behavior: Program gathers user input and returns as a number.
* Input Example: 5
* Output Example: 5

#### Spec 2
* Behavior: The program returns false / does not run if the number is less than 0.
* Input Example: -9
* Output Example: false / program does not run

#### Spec 3
* Behavior: The program returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user's inputted number
* Input Example: 4
* Output Example: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

#### Spec 4
* Behavior: The program will replace the number 1 with 'Beep!'.
* Input Example: 1
* Output Example: 'Beep!'

#### Spec 5
* Behavior: The program will replace the number 2 with 'Boop!'.
* Input Example: 2
* Output Example: 'Boop!'

#### Spec 6
* Behavior: The program will replace the number 3 with 'Won't you be my neighbor?'.
* Input Example: 3
* Output Example: 'Won't you be my neighbor?'

#### Spec 7
* Behavior: The program replaces all digits with 'Beep!' if the number contains a 1.
* Input Example: 10
* Output Example: 'Beep!'

#### Spec 8
* Behavior: The program replaces all digits with 'Boop!' if the number contains a 2.
* Input Example: 21
* Output Example: 'Boop!'

#### Spec 9
* Behavior: The program replaces all digits with 'Won't you be my neighbor?' if the number contains a 3
* Input Example: 23
* Output Example: 'Won't you be my neighbor?'

#### Spec 10
* Behavior: If username is entered, program will return 'Won't you be my neighbor, name?'
* Input Example: Zoidberg
* Output Example: 'Won't you be my neighbor, Zoidberg?'
